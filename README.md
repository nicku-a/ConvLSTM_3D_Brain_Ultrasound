# Using Machine Learning to Accelerate 3D Ultrasound Brain Imaging
This is a final year project as part of my MEng Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London


### Background

There currently exists no brain imaging modality that, providing high resolution imaging capabilities, is portable, cheap and generally safe. Existing modalities such as MRI and CT are characterised by the use of expensive and non-portable equipment, while MRI cannot be applied in the presence of ferromagnetic objects and CT uses ionising radiation.
Recently, ultrasound-based imaging of the brain has been proposed as a promising alternative based on full-waveform inversion, a technique developed in geophysics. However, current full-waveform inversion algorithms need several hours to produce 3D reconstructions of the brain, making them unsuitable for the time scales that are necessary for clinical imaging.


### Objectives

This project intends to explore ways in which machine learning techniques could be used to accelerate these reconstructions by effectively reducing the computational domain in which the reconstruction process takes place. In order to do so, deep learning models will be trained and integrated into finite-difference codes in Python.
